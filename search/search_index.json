The CCPP is explicitly designed to allow for compile-time selection of precision at the physics suite level as well as for individual fields.

A classic example is chemistry which ACOM would like to make modular but which is currently entwined with CAM in many areas (e.g., code in CAM repository, extensive configuration code dedicated to chemistry, extensive namelist building code and data dedicated to chemistry, large number of use cases containing chemistry configuration data). The new CAM infrastructure contains features to increase modularity.</p> <ul> <li>Support for multiple namelists. This allows modular components to contain their own namelist (run-time configuration options). The active namelists are combined to produce atm_in.</li> <li>Flexible handling of constituent information. Modular components can provide constituent information via metadata (if component is a CCPP scheme) or at run time.</li> </ul> <p>Modularity will allow CAM to move components to external repositories. This process cuts development costs for both CAM and for the component (e.g., as has happened with PUMAS). Some ways this is accomplished are listed here:</p> <ul> <li>Code reviews are more efficient since CAM SEs do not have to review every routine in the external module so they can just focus on the interfaces. The external developers do not have to be involved in CAM modifications.</li> <li>Externals can develop and maintain they own namelist definition files, they do not have to coordinate with the larger CAM namelist (which itself has been broken into several smaller namelists).</li> <li>Namelists associated with physics schemes do not have to have separate namelist-reading code. The new infrastructure automatically creates an appropriate Fortran module to read in the runtime data from atm_in. The system then also ensures that all active namelists are called at run time. This process ensures that namelists are always read correctly while not requiring coding or reviews to keep up to date with namelist changes.</li> </ul> <p>Use of the CCPP to build physics suites also makes CAM more modular because the CCPP treats physics schemes as modular which allows flexibility in building physics suites.
